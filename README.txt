(K8s_Containerd_Nvidia.yml, master.yml, workers.yml, inventory.ini, nv-ingest.yml, and gpu-test.yaml) can achieve the goals outlined in the README.md.

1. inventory.ini

Defines the master node (c267), worker nodes (c276 and icgpu10), and GPU node (icgpu10).
Sets common variables like ansible_user, ansible_ssh_private_key_file, and ansible_python_interpreter.
Includes variables for NV-Ingest deployment (e.g., namespace, ngc_api_key).
Alignment with README:

Correctly defines the nodes and their roles.
Provides necessary variables for the playbooks.
2. K8s_Containerd_Nvidia.yml

Install and Configure Containerd with NVIDIA Support:
Installs Containerd and configures it for Kubernetes.
Detects NVIDIA GPUs and configures the NVIDIA runtime.
Installs Kubernetes components (kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl).
Initialize Kubernetes Control Plane:
Initializes the cluster on the master node using kubeadm init.
Sets up kubeconfig and deploys the Flannel CNI plugin.
Join Worker Nodes to Cluster:
Joins worker nodes (c276 and icgpu10) to the cluster using kubeadm join.
Labels the GPU node (icgpu10) with gpu=true.
Deploy NVIDIA Device Plugin:
Deploys the NVIDIA Device Plugin on the master node.
Alignment with README:

Covers all the steps outlined in the README:
GPU-specific configuration on icgpu10.
Master and worker node setup.
GPU worker labeling.
Deploy NVIDIA Device Plugin.
3. master.yml

Master Node Setup:
Creates the /etc/kubernetes directory and generates an SSH key.
Configures kubeadm-config.yaml for cluster initialization.
Initializes the cluster using kubeadm init.
Sets up kubeconfig for the user.
Deploys the Flannel CNI plugin.
Deploys the NVIDIA Device Plugin (if GPU is present).
Alignment with README:

Handles the master node setup and initialization.
Deploys the Flannel CNI plugin and NVIDIA Device Plugin.
4. workers.yml

Worker Node Setup:
Fetches the join command from the master node.
Joins worker nodes to the cluster using kubeadm join.
Labels the GPU node (icgpu10) with gpu=true.
Alignment with README:

Joins worker nodes to the cluster.
Labels the GPU node for GPU scheduling.
5. nv-ingest.yml

NV-Ingest Deployment:
Creates the nv-ingest namespace.
Adds NVIDIA Helm repositories.
Installs the NV-Ingest Helm chart.
Optionally creates Kubernetes Secrets for pulling images from the NVIDIA NGC registry.
Alignment with README:

This playbook is for deploying NV-Ingest, which is not explicitly mentioned in the README. However, it complements the setup by deploying NV-Ingest on the Kubernetes cluster.
6. gpu-test.yaml

GPU Test Pod:
Defines a Kubernetes pod that runs nvidia-smi to test GPU support.
Alignment with README:

Provides a way to test GPU workloads, as mentioned in the README.
Gaps and Recommendations

Testing GPU Workloads:
The gpu-test.yaml file is provided, but the README does not explicitly mention how to apply it. You can add a section in the README explaining how to test GPU workloads:
bash
Copy
kubectl apply -f gpu-test.yaml
kubectl logs gpu-test
Cleanup and Troubleshooting:
The README mentions "Cleanup" and "Troubleshooting" sections, but these are not detailed. You can add steps for:
Deleting the GPU test pod:
bash
Copy
kubectl delete pod gpu-test
Troubleshooting common issues (e.g., GPU not detected, pods not scheduling on GPU nodes).
NV-Ingest Deployment:
The README does not mention NV-Ingest, but the nv-ingest.yml playbook is provided. If NV-Ingest is part of the setup, you should add a section in the README explaining its purpose and how to deploy it.
Prerequisites:
The README lists prerequisites, but it does not mention the need for an NVIDIA NGC API key for NV-Ingest deployment. You should add this to the prerequisites.
